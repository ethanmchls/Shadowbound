# Shadowbound
This is an indie 2D platformer game with a twist. You, the player, are bound to your shadow. If you jump, your shadow jumps. If you move right, your shadow moves right. If you hit a wall, your shadow stops in its tracks. The goal, like any platformer, is to get to the end of the map, one level at a time.

It's a major work in progress at this point in time, but it should be playable soon enough. There's a lot left to do with mechanics, art, music, and level design.
